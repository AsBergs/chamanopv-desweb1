  <div id="div2">
    <h1 id="h1">The Butterflies Are All Dead</h1>
    The books are dusted <br>
    The stores are closed <br>
    The doors are shut <br>
    And i'm so sorry to tell you that <br>
    The butterflies are all dead <br>
    I really wish i could feel it again <br>
    But the roller coaster stopped working
    <br>
    Maybe boring love it's all i'm fated to have <br>
    Maybe boring love is the only one that last <br>
    But i think you deserve more than someone who spends the whole time wishing their nights were brighter
    <br>
    The rush keeps me alive <br>
    The hush makes me wanna die <br>
    Silly me for wanting a romance like in the movies <br>
    There's nobody out there whose gonna make my heart beat faster <br>
    I should be clever and settle for a normal love <br>
    Or it's like they say, i'll die alone.

<div id="div3">
 <h1 id="h1-primaria">Looking For You</h1>
 In my head i like to think that you're looking for me <br>
 Everywhere you go you try to find my face <br>
 That everytime you pass through our old school <br>
 You hope to see me waiting for you as if nothing has changed <br>
 
 I gotta let it go, i know <br>
 But in my head i like to think that you're searching for me <br>
 Every song you listen to <br>
 You find something that reminds you of me <br>
 In my head i like to think that you meet me in your dreams <br>
 
 In my head i like to think that my name will curse you for the rest of your life <br>
 That everytime you hear my favorite song  playing <br>
 you'll have nothing besides me in your mind <br>
 
 In my head i like to think that you're' looking for me <br>
 But you never did, and now you never will <br>
 I was always looking for you <br>
 But now i'll never get to
</div>


<div id="div4">
  <h1 id="h1-primaria">Fair</h1>
  No, i dont think it's fair <br>
  You, moving on that fast <br>
  I fake a smile at every picture <br>
  You're dancing at every party in this city <br>
  Everyday feels like a fucking disaster <br>
  But i heard from friend that  for you life was never better <br>
  Is it me who feels too much or is it you that doesnt at all? <br>
  Is it my fault? <br>
  Did i make too hard loving me? <br>
  
  I search for your face at every crowded room <br>
  I look for a glimpse of you at every person in this city <br>
  Everything reminds me of you <br>
  But s√£o paulo's grey skies only brings you back to me mentally <br>
  
  No, i dont think it's fair <br>
  I could easly had turned you into the villain but i didnt <br>
  So Dont you think i deserve some of your mercy  <br>
  
  You could had taken it back <br>
  (You could've take it back) <br>
  All the cruel words you said <br>
  You didnt have to make me sad <br>
  But you did it cause you needed to feel better than me <br>
  When everybody asks, you say theres no hard feelings <br>
  That we both wish each other best <br>
  You tell 'em the story with the happy ending <br>
  But i dont think it's fair <br>
  No, i dont think it's fair <br>
  
  I break down at every party bathroom <br>
  All paths lead me back to you <br>
  I cant move on even if you wanted to <br>
  Am i the only one who ever felt in love? <br>
  You say we're friends <br>
  But i'm sick and tired of playing pretend <br>
  
  Dont wanna see you again and feel my heart beating fast <br>
  I wanna be unable to recognize you on the street <br>
  I'm tired of dancing with your ghost <br>
  Cant you just leave me alone?
