<h2>
    The Origin
</h2>
<p>
First called "Gramaphone Awards", this award is part of the "EGOT", the four most important award of the american(USA) entertainment, "E"(Emmy, television), 
"G"(Grammys, music), "O"(Oscar's, cinema)
and "T"(Tony's, teather).Only a few of artists has conquered the title of "EGOT"(ex. Whoopi Goldberg, Audrey Hepburn, John Legend, Alan Menken...) <br>
The Grammys had their origin in the Hollywood Walk of Fame project in the 1950s. As recording executives on the Walk of Fame committee compiled a list of significant 
recording industry people who might qualify for a Walk of Fame star, they realized that many leading people in their business would not earn a star on Hollywood 
Boulevard. They determined to rectify this by creating awards given by their industry similar to the Oscars and the Emmys. After deciding to go forward with such 
awards, a question remained what to call them. One working title was the ‘Eddie’, to honor Thomas Edison, the inventor of the phonograph. Eventually, the name was 
chosen after a mail-in contest whereby approximately 300 contestants submitted the name 'Grammy', with the earliest postmark from contest winner Jay Danna of New 
Orleans, Louisiana, as an abbreviated reference Emile Berliner's invention, the gramophone. Grammys were first awarded for achievements in 1958.
The first award ceremony was held simultaneously in two locations on May 4, 1959, the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, and the Park Sheraton Hotel 
in New York City, New York, with 28 Grammys awarded. The number of awards given grew, at one time reaching over 100, and fluctuated over the years with categories 
added and removed. The second Grammy Awards, also held in 1959, was the first ceremony to be televised, but the ceremony was not aired live until the 13th Annual 
Grammy Awards in 1971

<h4>The Latin Grammy's</h4>
<p>
    The Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences (now The Latin Recording Academy) was formed by the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences 
    (now The Recording Academy) in 1997. It was founded by Michael Greene and Producers & Songwriters Rudy Pérez & Mauricio Abaroa. Rudy Pérez was the Grammy 
    Florida chapter's first President of the Board. The concept of a separate Grammy Awards for Latin music began in 1989.According to organizers, the Latin Grammy 
    Awards was established as the Latin music universe was deemed too large to fit on the Grammy Awards. The Latin Recording Academy defines Latin music as music in 
    Spanish or Portuguese.The Latin Grammy Awards mainly encompasses music released in Latin America, Spain, Portugal and the Latino United States.ncluding the Latino
    population in Canada, these regions are defined as "Ibero America" by the Latin Recording Academy.In 2000, it was announced that the 1st Annual Latin Grammy 
    Awards would take place at the Staples Center on September 13, 2000. On July 7, 2000, the nominations were announced in Miami, Florida, United States. The Latin 
    Grammys were introduced with over 39 categories included limited to Spanish and Portuguese-speaking recordings. 
    The first telecast took place at the Staples Center and was broadcast. The following year's show was canceled due to the September 11, 2001 attacks, 
    which was the same day the show was to take place.In 2002, the academy elected its first independent Board of Trustees. In 2005, the broadcast was moved from CBS 
    to Univision where the whole telecast was in Spanish.
<br>
    Voting members live in various regions in the US and outside of the US including Latin America and Iberia.For a recording to be eligible for a nomination, 
    it must have at least 51% of its content recorded in Spanish or Portuguese and commercially released in North America, Central America, South America, 
    the Caribbean, Spain, or Portugal.Products recorded in languages and dialects from Ibero-America such as Catalan, Basque, Galician, Valencian, Nahuatl, 
    Guarani, Quechua or Mayan may be accepted by majority vote of the committees of the Latin Recording Academy. The Latin Recording Academy also accepts Latin 
    instrumental music from Ibero-America as well as compositions that have been composed or interpreted by an Iberian American musician. The eligibility period is June 1 to May 30 for a respective awards ceremony. Recordings are first entered and then reviewed to determine the awards they are eligible for. Following that, nominating ballots are mailed to voting members of the academy. The votes are tabulated and the five recordings in each category with the most votes become the nominees. Final voting ballots are sent out to voting members and the winners are determined. Winners are later announced at the Latin Grammy Awards. The current President & CEO of the Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences is Manuel Abud, who succeeded Gabriel Abaroa in 2021.
    Altogether there are three events: the Life Achievement when renowned artists are honored for lifetime achievement; Person of the Year, when one artist is honored 
    at a gala dinner, and Grammy itself, an award that brings together artists from all over Latin America and Iberia and that today is broadcast live to 80 countries,
    including Brazil, by channel Univision (TNT in Brazil).
