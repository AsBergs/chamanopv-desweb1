The sister's albums folklore and evermore of the american singer Taylor Swift, are definitely two of the best albums in the world, they were both made in 2020 during the pandemic.The albuns were written and produced almost enterily by Swift, producers Jack Antnoff and Aaron Dessner, also contain songwritting credits to Justin Vernon from Bon Iver and William Bowery, the last one caused a little comotion because nobody knew who he was, then fans came up with the teory that was Swift's long time boyfriend, the british actor Joe Alwyn, teory which Taylor herself confirmed in the Long Pond Studio Sessions she did for folklore. The diversy of things that are brought in the songs was a really good point of the albums, with these albuns, Swift's pushes aside writting about her own experencies and more about other people's, the themes went addction, drepression and anxiety, domestic abuse, to  wars and the proper pandemic, all of them were written in this mytical way, like if they were tales she was telling. foklore won "Album Of The Year" at the 2021's Grammys and evermore got a nomination one year later.

The sophomore album of the singer & songwritter Billie Eilish is, in my opinion, superior than her debut album who made her won five grammys (including the "big four") in one night, this album has much more sentimental and soft lyrics than her previous one, it still is this teenage anger but now more sad somehow, she talks about abusive realationship she had and about how hard is being a young women in the industry
The album was enterily written by her and her brother Finneas, produced by Finneas(which is also a singer) like all of her songs. The album was nominated to 7 grammy awards, lost them all but still is considered one of the best albums of the decade. The songs are calm, angry, sad, sexy, a hurricane of emotions like Billie's life, a girl that started in the industry at 14 years old, and got bodyshamed by the whole internet because of the baggy clothes she likes to wear, things that she claps back in the songs "Not My Responsibility" and "OverHeated".

The album made off of the songs from the Bo Burnham's fifth comedy special "inside", is definitely one the best works released during the pandemic, the special is a sarcastic, ironic and somehow melancholic vision of the pandemic and the way humans lead with it, the songs have comic timing (chef's kiss) incridible, he's known by making jokes about everything and everyone, but mostly about himself and people like him (white american straight males). The last special Bo made was in 2015, back in the day he quit performing comedy because he was having several panic attacks while on stage, he spent five years recluse from the world, in january of 2020, he decided to come back then by his own words "the funniest things happened". The special was considered by many critics and public, one of the best things made by the visual industry in 2020. Bo burnham wrote, directed, edited, starred, produced, everything all by himself. In 2022 he released the deluxe version of the album, with the songs that didn't made the special.This work is Burnham's best avaliated work at the metacritic and many others critic websites. The song "All Eyes On Me" won the grammy for "Best Song Written for Visual Media"</p>

Taylor's third album "Speak Now" is a really great, coehsive and mature body of work and definitely a blast, Swift wrote this album enterily by herself at 19 years old, after many critics say that she doesn't write her own song, her name was credited in all of the songs from her previous albums, they didn't belive her, so she proved them wrong by writing an album all by herself. The album was nominated to 3 grammys, winning two with the song "Mean", it also made it to many lists of best albums of 2010. The songs of the album are a country with a little of pop, it brings magical, sad, love feelings, is something very especific but very relatable, in my opinion better than her Album Of The Year grammy winner previous album, this one is much more mature but still a little teen because Taylor still learning to be adult. If This Was A Movie supremacy!!!

The album "SUPERBLOOM" from the american indie pop band "MisterWives", is a truly heartbreak album, it's about the end of a long time relantionship between the lead singer Mandy Lee with another band member,  Etienne Bowle, they separated after 8 years together, it narrates since the beginning of the end until the beginning of her new relantionship, purity heartache, it pass through all stages of grief until the accptance, the name of the album is a rare desert botanical phenomenon in which an unusually high proportion of wildflowers whose seeds have lain dormant in desert soil germinate and blossom at roughly the same time. The phenomenon is associated with an unusually wet rainy season. The term may have developed as a label in the 1990s.There's a lot of heartbreak songs out in the world, but this one lead us through all the different stages of it, the denying, the angrying, the Bargaining, the depression, the aceptance and the "begin again", is not just a avulse song or other thrown away in the album, is a complete body of work.

The second album from the New Zealander singer & songwritter Lorde, "Melodrama" is an magnficent body of work, is sad, dancy, happy.In my opinion the songs in this album are way better than all the other songs of her, is insane to know that Ella (Lorde) at 19 wrote such a mature album, the album is placed at this kind of party, it lead us through the beginning until the after party, things that are clearly seen in songs like  "Green Light, "Sober", "Sober II" and Perfect Places.It got a few grammy nominations, incluiding the biggest of the night but Ella refuse to go to the Grammys after not being invited to perform at the show, she ended up losing to Bruno mars, which in my opinion is unfair because her album was way much better than his, but the academy doesnt like young women going agaisnt them. The album after Melodrama had a hard test of being better than a perfection  that even people who dont like Lorde (me) have to agree that is a bop, but it wasnt impossible, unfortunately that didnt happened, Lorde's third album "Solar Power" is not that bad like people say but it's definitely lower in quality.
