The sister's albums folklore and evermore of the american singer Taylor Swift, are definitely two of the best albums in the world, 
they were both made in 2020 during the pandemic.The albuns were written and produced almost enterily by Swift, producers Jack Antnoff and 
Aaron Dessner, also contain songwritting credits to Justin Vernon from Bon Iver and William Bowery, the last one caused a little comotion 
because nobody knew who he was, then fans came up with the teory that was Swift's long time boyfriend, the british actor Joe Alwyn, teory 
which Taylor herself confirmed in the Long Pond Studio Sessions she did for folklore. The diversity of things that are brought in the songs 
was a really good point of the albums, with these albuns, Swift's pushes aside writting about her own experencies and writes more about other 
people's, the themes went from addction, drepression and anxiety, domestic abuse, to  wars and the proper pandemic, all of them were written 
in this mytical metaphorical way, like if they were little kid's tales she was telling. <br>  foklore won "Album Of The Year" at the 2021's Grammys and evermore got a 
nomination one year later. Taylor Swift has been years in this industry and after her previous album "Lover" being considered lower in quality 
by the critics and also her fans, Taylor thought that "Lover" was her last chance to acheive some kind of sucess before the media get sick of
her, woman in the industry got expiration date. With these album Swift showed the world that she was still very much on the game.

The sophomore album of the singer & songwritter Billie Eilish is, in my opinion, superior than her debut album who made her won 
five grammys (including the "big four") in one night, this album has much more sentimental, soft lyrics and also less metaphorical
than her previous one, is more literal as if were written by different people, this strategy used is to show people that Billie has grown out
of the "dark theme" and that she knows how to sing with a clear and higher voice - something that Eilish has faced throughout her career is 
the critics to her whispered voice - 
although still having that teenage anger but sadder now, somehow. Billie sings about abusive realationship she had and about how hard is being a 
young women in the industry <br>
The album was enterily written by her and her brother Finneas, produced by Finneas(which is also a singer) like all of her songs. 
The album was nominated to 7 grammy awards, lost them all but still is considered one of the best albums of the decade. The songs are calm,
angry, sad, sexy, a hurricane of emotions like Billie's life, a girl that started in the industry at 14 years old, and got bodyshamed by 
the whole internet because of the baggy clothes she likes to wear, things that she claps back in the songs "Not My Responsibility" and 
"OverHeated". At the beginning of this era. with the release of "Therefore I Am", "NDA" and "My Future", this era was called "flop era" because
neither of the songs got a high position on the charts, but with the release of the whole album, people changed their minds. <br> Now for a 
lot of people (like myself) think this album much better than her previous one

The album made off of the songs from the Bo Burnham's fifth comedy special, "inside", is definitely one the best works released during the 
pandemic, the special is a sarcastic, ironic and somehow melancholic vision of the pandemic and the way humans lead with it, the songs 
have a comic timing (chef's kiss) incridible. Bo started really young, at only 16; He's known by making jokes about everything and everyone, but mostly about himself and people 
like him (white american straight males).  <br> The last special Bo made was "Make Happy" in 2015, after going on tour and realesing the 
special on Netflix, he quit performing comedy because he was having several panic attacks while on stage, he spent five years recluse
from the world, and in january of 2020, he decided to do his come back but then - by his own words -  "the funniest thing happened". 
The special was considered by many critics and also the public, 
one of the best things made by the visual industry in 2020. <br> Bo burnham wrote, directed, edited, starred, produced, everything all by himself. <br>
In 2022 he released the deluxe version of the album, with the songs that didn't made the special.This work is Burnham's best avaliated work 
at the metacritic and many others critic websites. The song "All Eyes On Me" won the grammy for "Best Song Written for Visual Media"

Taylor's third album, "Speak Now", is a really great, coehsive and mature body of work and definitely a blast, Swift wrote this album enterily
by herself at 19 years old, after many critics say that she doesn't write her own song, besides her name being credited in all of the songs 
from her previous albums, they didn't belive her, so she proved them wrong by writing an album all by herself. <br>
The album was nominated to 3 grammys,
winning two with the song "Mean", it also made it to many lists of best albums of 2010. The songs of the album are a country with a little 
of pop, it brings magical, sad, love feelings, it's something very especific but very relatable, in my opinion better than her Album Of The 
Year grammy winner previous album, this one is much more mature but still a little teen because Taylor still learning to be adult. If This

The album "SUPERBLOOM" from the american indie pop band "MisterWives", is a truly heartbreak album, it's about the end of a long time 
relantionship between the lead singer Mandy Lee with another band member, Etienne Bowle, they separated after 8 years together, 
it narrates since the beginning of the end until the beginning of her new relantionship, purity heartache, it pass through all stages 
of grief until the accptance, the name of the album is a rare desert botanical phenomenon in which an unusually high proportion of 
wildflowers whose seeds have lain dormant in desert soil germinate and blossom at roughly the same time. The phenomenon is associated 
with an unusually wet rainy season. The term may have developed as a label in the 1990s.There's a lot of heartbreak songs out in the world, 
but this one lead us through all the different stages of it, the denying, the angrying, the Bargaining, the depression, the aceptance and 
the "begin again", it's not just a avulse song or other thrown away in the album, it's a complete body of work. A masterpiece Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.

The second album from the New Zealander singer & songwritter Lorde, "Melodrama" is an magnficent body of work, is sad, dancy, 
happy.In my opinion the songs in this album are way better than all the other songs of her, is insane to know that Ella (Lorde) at 
19 wrote such a mature album, the album is placed at this kind of party, it lead us through the beginning until the after party, 
things that are clearly seen in songs like  "Green Light, "Sober", "Sober II" and Perfect Places.It got a few grammy nominations, 
incluiding the biggest of the night but Ella refuse to go to the Grammys after not being invited to perform at the show, she ended 
up losing to Bruno mars, which in my opinion is unfair because her album was way much better than his, but the academy doesnt like 
young women going agaisnt them. The album after Melodrama had a hard test of being better than a perfection  that even people who
dont like Lorde (me) have to agree that is a bop, but it wasnt impossible, unfortunately that didnt happened, Lorde's third album 
"Solar Power" is not that bad like people say but it's definitely lower in quality.
